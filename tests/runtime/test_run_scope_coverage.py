"""Every run entry point must open a ``run_scope``.

A missed boundary is a *silent fail-open*: outside a scope ``get_run_facts()``
returns ``DETACHED``, which reads zeros, so ``run.tool_calls < 20`` would pass
forever and nothing else in the suite would notice.

Hence two halves: :func:`_boundaries` derives the expected set from method
signatures, catching an entry point added later; ``SCOPE_SITES`` pins where each
opens it. The source-text assertions are deliberate — what is guarded against is a
missing line of code.
