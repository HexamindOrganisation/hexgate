    """Load environment variables and return validated settings.

    ``override=False`` so a shell-set env var wins over the same key in
    ``.env`` — matches the convention every other tool (uvicorn, vite,
    cargo, npm…) follows. Treats ``.env`` as a default-provider, not
    an authoritative override.

    Configures the process-wide audit sender unless ``local_only=True``,
    in which case ``HEXGATE_LOCAL_MODE=1`` is set in the environment
    BEFORE :func:`audit.configure` runs — that's what makes the gate
    stick: any later adapter wrapper that re-``configure``s (every
    ``wrap_*_agent``, ``HexgateAgent.enforce_policy``) checks the same
    env var and stays inert. ``hexgate chat`` opts in this way; the
    examples and unit tests inherit it transitively.

    Audit sends are fire-and-forget background tasks: when the event loop
    tears down at exit they are cancelled, not finished, so events
    emitted shortly before exit are lost unless the teardown path
    explicitly drains with ``await audit.shutdown()``.

    The ``HEXGATE_KEY + HEXGATE_LOCAL_POLICY`` combination almost always
    means a dev forgot to clean up their env between an "I'm trying the
    platform" session and an "I'm iterating on a YAML policy" session.
    Log a single WARNING line so the surprise lands at startup, not three
    debug sessions later when they wonder why their policy edits
    aren't taking.
