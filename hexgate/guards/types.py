"""Types and authoring decorators for the tool-guard pipeline.

A *guard* is a function you attach before or after a tool call with the
``@before_tool`` / ``@after_tool`` decorators. It receives the
:class:`ToolCall` (and, after the tool runs, the :class:`ToolOutcome`) and
returns :class:`Proceed` (carry on, optionally rewriting args), :class:`Halt`
(refuse), or ``None`` (the same as ``Proceed()``).

You register guards as one flat ``guards=[...]`` list; the framework splits them
into a pre list and a post list by their decoration, preserving order within
each. There is no ``Guard`` type to construct by hand: position is the decorator
you used, and reach is the decorator's ``tool_names`` argument. See
``docs/adr/R-GUARD-001..003`` and the runner in :mod:`hexgate.guards.runner`.
