"""Tool guards: functions that run before and after a tool call.

Author a guard with ``@before_tool`` / ``@after_tool``; it observes a call,
rewrites its args (before only), or halts. Register guards as one flat
``guards=[...]`` list on the agent. See ``tool-guards-explained.md`` for the
intuition, ``docs/adr/R-GUARD-001..003`` for the decisions, and the later phases
(result rewrite, egress, official plugins) in ``ROADMAP.md``.
