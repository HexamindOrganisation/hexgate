"""Biscuit verification helpers for the SDK side.

The platform mints Biscuit tokens signed by its root Ed25519 keypair. The
SDK verifies them locally before trusting them for any call. We deliberately
mirror only the *verify-side* of the platform's wrapper — minting and
attenuation are platform/dev concerns and don't belong in the SDK runtime.

Three responsibilities live here:

1. Parse the human-readable envelope ``fty_<env>_<project>_<biscuit_b64>``
   into its parts. The Biscuit payload itself contains underscores
   (URL-safe base64), so the parser splits on the first three only.

2. Verify the signature chain against an expected public key. A token
   that was tampered with, signed by a different key, or just garbled
   raises :class:`TokenSignatureError`.

3. Extract single-arity facts from every block of a verified token, so the
   policy engine can read user attribution / scope / numeric-limit metadata
   stamped in by the dev's backend during attenuation.

Defense in depth — the platform also verifies on the bearer-auth path,
but verifying client-side catches misconfiguration at startup instead of
on the first failed API call.
