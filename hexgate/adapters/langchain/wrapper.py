"""BYO-graph entry point: retrofit a pre-built ``CompiledStateGraph`` with
Hexgate policy. Tools are mutated in place so the graph keeps its
references; the returned :class:`HexgateLangchainAgent` opens a User
scope + Langfuse propagation per call. For the manifest-driven path,
use :func:`hexgate.enforce_policy` instead.

Policy is resolved from the platform at wrap time (fail-loud on a 404 —
register the agent first with ``hexgate register``) and refreshed by the
proxy at the top of every call.
