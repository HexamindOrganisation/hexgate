"""Policy binding — hold an enforcer, keep it current from a source.

Tools close over the enforcer, so :meth:`PolicyBinding.refresh` (called
at every run boundary) hot-swaps ``enforcer.policy`` for all of them.
Resolve is fail-loud, refresh is fail-soft (stale, never unverified).
A platform 404 propagates; callers register and resolve again. No
implicit allow-all — static engines go through the plain constructor.
