"""Analyze a linked policy bundle for authoring problems — the lint layer.

The linker (:mod:`hexgate.security.linker`) *raises* :class:`LinkError` for the
unfixable cases (a capability that denies, a conflicting const, ``file_scope`` in
a module). This module runs over a **successfully linked** bundle and reports the
*soft* problems that don't stop composition but are almost always mistakes:

- **dead-grant** — a capability grants a tool a boundary ceiling excludes, so the
  grant never fires.
- **redundant-grant** — two capabilities grant the same tool identically.
- **unknown-tool** / **unknown-arg** — a rule references a tool or arg absent from
  the agent's manifest (drift between policy and code). Only checked when a
  manifest is supplied; boundary drift is fail-open, so it's an error.
- **permissive-default** — the ``default`` role grants something no named role
  grants (:func:`check_default_role_exposure`, over a resolved role map).

Every :class:`PolicyLint` carries the ``source`` file it attributes to — the same
contract the CLI (`hexgate policy check`) and the dashboard editor both consume.
Deferred (needs a solver): semantic conflicts — empty intersection, always-true /
always-false, subsumption.
