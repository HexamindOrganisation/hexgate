"""Role-aware policy bundles — load, resolve inheritance, pick by role.

A single ``policy.yaml`` is the legacy shape (one policy applies to every
caller). A ``policies/`` directory is the new shape:

    agent/
    ├── agent.yaml
    ├── system.md
    └── policies/
        ├── default.yaml      # fallback when the caller's roles are unknown
        ├── read_only.yaml    # mixin — is_mixin: true
        ├── support.yaml      # inherits: [read_only]
        └── billing.yaml      # inherits: [read_only, support]

A :class:`PolicySet` holds the resolved (post-inheritance) policy per role
name, plus the ``default`` fallback. The enforcer calls ``policy_for(role)``
once per role the caller carries; this module stays single-role.

``default`` is a *fallback*, not a *floor*: a caller whose role is defined never
inherits it. For a baseline shared by every role, use a mixin and ``inherits``.

Inheritance semantics: left-to-right merge — ``inherits: [A, B]`` resolves
to ``merge(A, merge(B, self))``, where ``merge`` deep-merges the ``tools``
maps (child entries override parent entries by tool name) and replaces
scalar fields (``default_policy``) with the child's value when set.

Mixin policies (``is_mixin: true``) can only be referenced via ``inherits``
— they're never picked as the effective policy for any context scope.
