"""Compile a Hexgate ``policy.yaml`` document into a Rego policy module.

The compiler is a pure-Python transformation: parsed YAML payload →
``PolicySet`` (which flattens ``inherits:`` and drops ``is_mixin:`` entries)
→ a Rego source string suitable for ``opa build -t wasm``.

Why this lives in the SDK (not just the platform): the same compiler runs
in three places — the platform's save-time pipeline, the ``hexgate policy
build`` CLI a dev uses for local iteration, and CI/CD wrapper scripts.
Identical artifacts everywhere; the only thing the platform adds is the
Ed25519 signature on the resulting bundle.

Output structure
----------------

The module exposes a single ``decision`` entrypoint that returns the
full verdict as a structured object. The runtime evaluates one query
per tool-call and receives back ``{allow, requires_approval, violations}``:

    package hexgate.policy

    import rego.v1

    default allow := false
    default requires_approval := false

    # The single entrypoint the runtime queries.
    decision := {
        "allow": allow,
        "requires_approval": requires_approval,
        "violations": violations,
    }

    # ---- role: billing ----
    allow if {
        input.role == "billing"
        input.tool == "refund_order"
        input.args.amount <= 500
    }

    violations contains `args.amount <= 500` if {
        input.role == "billing"
        input.tool == "refund_order"
        not input.args.amount <= 500
    }

Deny is implicit — a tool with ``mode: deny`` produces no allow rule and
no violation rules, so ``allow`` stays false and the deny reason is
just "no allow rule matched" (caller's job to surface that).

The ``violations`` set carries the raw constraint string from the YAML
verbatim, so deny reasons in production match exactly what the dev
wrote in their policy file.

Constraint translation
----------------------

The grammar already mirrors Rego conditions, so translation is one step:
each ``args.<field>`` path becomes ``input.args.<field>``. We re-use
:func:`parse_constraint` for the AST so the path / operator / literal are
already structured — we don't text-substitute. Every constraint emits
*two* contributions: one positive (added to the allow rule body) and
one negative (a ``violations contains`` rule).
