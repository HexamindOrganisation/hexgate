"""Agent-level admission enforcement.

:class:`AgentGate` is to a whole agent run what the egress :class:`~hexgate.egress.gate.Gate`
is to a network request: one place that reuses :meth:`PolicyEnforcer.decide` for
a non-tool subject. It gates *admission* — may this caller, in this role, run this
agent — by deciding the synthetic ``agent.run`` key at run entry, before the model
sees anything.

Engagement is opt-in. The gate enforces only when the current policy declares an
``admission`` block anywhere, read per run via ``PolicyEngine.declares_admission()``
(not at build time), so an agent whose policy never mentions admission runs exactly
as before, and a hot-reloaded policy that adds or drops admission is honored on the
next run. Once admission is declared, agent keys are closed-world (R-AGENT-002): a
caller whose role is not granted admission is refused, so a silent co-role can
neither admit an unknown caller nor defeat an explicit deny. A denial is
caller-facing: admission fires before the model runs, so there is no tool result to
render into, the run simply does not start.
