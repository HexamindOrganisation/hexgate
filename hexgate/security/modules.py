"""Data model for stacked policy modules and the linker's output.

A *module* is an :class:`~hexgate.security.models.AgentPolicy` fragment given an
identity (``name``), a tier (``kind``), an origin (``source``), and a content
hash. Modules compose — via :mod:`hexgate.security.linker` — into one effective
policy per agent, which then compiles to Rego/WASM exactly as a single policy
does today.

Everything here is SDK-side: devs load, link, and lint modules locally with no
platform. ``content_hash`` is the content-identity half of versioning (cheap, no
DB) — present now so durable version history can clip on later without rework.
