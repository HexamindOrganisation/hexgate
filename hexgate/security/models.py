    ``inherits`` names other policy bundles whose ``tools`` map is merged

    policies like ``read_only`` that several roles share.

    ``is_mixin = True`` marks the policy as a building block — the SDK
    won't pick it as the effective policy for any HexgateContext scope; it can only
    be referenced via ``inherits``.

    ``consts`` names reusable values referenced from constraints as
    ``consts.<name>`` (e.g. ``args.amount <= consts.max_refund``). Merged
    through ``inherits`` like ``tools`` — put shared constants in a mixin.

    ``trusted_attributes`` names the ``ctx.<key>`` attributes taken only from
    the signed Biscuit, not the spoofable contextvar bag: a trusted key absent
    from the token fails closed. Unlisted keys stay advisory. Merged through
    ``inherits`` like ``consts``.

    "Trusted" means *asserted by the holder of the project API key (your
    backend) and verifiable downstream by the platform* — not unforgeable within
    your own process. Populate the values from trusted server-side data (an
    IdP/session), never raw client input, exactly as you would ``user_roles``.
