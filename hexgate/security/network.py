"""Network-egress policy contract — the synthetic tool name and constraint emitters.

Network egress is enforced as an ordinary tool call named ``net.http_request``:
the egress proxy maps each outbound HTTP(S) request onto it. This module is the
single source of truth for that name and for turning host/scheme/port allowlists
into constraint *strings* — the same grammar tool-call constraints use — so the
network rules compile to both engines (pydantic + WASM) with no special-casing.

Nothing here is a new enforcement path: it renders strings the existing
constraint parser (:mod:`hexgate.security.constraints`) and the Rego compiler
already accept.
