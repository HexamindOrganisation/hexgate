"""The linker — compose a bundle of policy modules into one effective policy.

The intermediate step between *many policy files* and *one signed WASM bundle*:

    [modules]  --link()-->  one AgentPolicy  --compile_to_rego-->  rego  -->  wasm

Composition lives here, at the model layer. The output is an ordinary
:class:`~hexgate.security.models.AgentPolicy` whose ``constraints`` are the same
strings the DSL already parses, so the pydantic-vs-WASM **parity gate applies to
the resolved policy for free** — the engines never see the stack.

Rules (see ``policy-modules-plan.md``): **fences intersect, grants union, denies
win.** Per ``(tool, args)`` the most restrictive layer wins:
``deny > approval_required > allow > implicit-deny``.

- **Boundary** — caps + hard denies. An unconditional deny is absolute. A
  ``default_policy: deny`` boundary is a *ceiling*: a tool it doesn't list is
  ineligible. Its ``allow`` entries are ceilings (permit up to a constraint),
  not grants.
- **Capability** — grants only (``allow`` / ``approval_required``). A capability
  ``deny`` is a :class:`LinkError`. Multiple capabilities granting one tool
  *union* (either condition suffices).

Constraint algebra reuses the existing DSL nodes: intersection is list
concatenation (``constraints: list[str]`` is implicit-AND), union is a top-level
``or`` expression, and a conditional boundary deny subtracts via ``and not(…)``.
Every assembled expression is re-parsed with :func:`parse_constraint` to validate
against the live grammar.
