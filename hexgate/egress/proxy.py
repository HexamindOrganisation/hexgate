"""In-process forward proxy that gates outbound egress through policy.

``EgressProxy`` is an optional second enforcement plane. Point an agent's
process at it (via ``HTTP_PROXY`` / ``HTTPS_PROXY``, which ``egress_guard``
sets for you) and every outbound HTTP(S) request is routed through the same
:class:`~hexgate.security.enforcer.PolicyEnforcer` that gates tool calls,
mapped to the synthetic ``net.http_request`` tool. See the network-egress
concept doc (``docs/concepts/egress.mdx``).

Scope (Tier 1): host-level filtering. HTTPS is gated on the ``CONNECT`` host;
the tunnel relays ciphertext untouched (no TLS interception). Like
``runtime/command_policy.py``, the env-proxy hookup is *intent-shaping, not a
hard boundary* — a tool that unsets the proxy env vars bypasses it. A sandbox
that forces all egress through the proxy is the hard-boundary follow-up.
