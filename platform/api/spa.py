"""Serve the built React dashboard (``dist/``) from the FastAPI app, same-origin.

The production image bakes the dashboard build into itself (see
``platform/api/Dockerfile``) and points ``HEXGATE_DASHBOARD_DIST`` at it, so the
API answers both ``/v1/*`` and the SPA on one origin — no separate edge
container, no CORS, no cross-origin cookie config. The same helper backs the
single-tenant demo bundle (:mod:`demo`).

:func:`mount_spa` MUST be called *after* ``app.include_router(v1)`` so the
``/v1`` API + WebSocket routes match before the catch-all SPA fallback —
Starlette matches in registration order, so registering this last is what keeps
``/v1/*`` from being shadowed by ``index.html``.
