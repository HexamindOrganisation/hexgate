"""In-memory WebSocket relay for serve-mode agent sessions.

The backend bridges two peer roles per project:

- **serve** (the developer's `fortify --serve` process) — one per project.
  New connections replace any existing one; the old socket is closed.
- **chat** (dashboard Playground tabs) — many per project. All chat sockets
  receive the same events from the serve peer.

Messages are opaque JSON blobs relayed unchanged. Synthetic events are
injected by the relay itself: `{"type": "agent_online", "online": bool}`
so the dashboard can render a live/offline indicator without polling.
