"""Pytest config shared across the platform-api test suite.

Two session-wide behaviours:

1. Enables the ``X-Dev-User`` test seam by default — production servers
   leave ``HEXGATE_ALLOW_DEV_USER_HEADER`` unset, but every test in this
   package uses the header to assert tenant-isolation and route gating
   without going through a real cookie login. The seam is gated in
   ``main.require_user`` (which all the cookie-side deps —
   ``require_org_member``, ``require_org_membership``,
   ``require_project_admin`` — chain through) so a deployment that
   forgets to disable it doesn't accidentally expose identity-asserting
   headers.

2. Skips ``@pytest.mark.integration`` tests unless run with
   ``pytest -m integration`` (they require a running ClickHouse).
