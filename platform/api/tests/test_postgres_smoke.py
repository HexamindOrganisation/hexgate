"""Opt-in Postgres smoke test — the only coverage of the asyncpg path.

The rest of the suite runs on SQLite, so this is the only test that points
the real engine at a live PG and round-trips a row. Skipped unless
``DATABASE_URL`` names a Postgres DSN (set by the ``platform-api-postgres``
CI job, or locally via ``make postgres-up``).
