"""Tests for ``WS /v1/serve`` — the token-implicit serve socket.

The Phase 6 design moves project context from the URL into the bearer
token. The CLI's ``hexgate serve`` connects via the
``bearer.<envelope>`` subprotocol; the server echoes ``hexgate.v1`` on
a successful handshake and resolves the project from the token row.

Five branches, one per test:

  1. No subprotocol header offered           → close 4401, no handshake
  2. Subprotocol present but no ``bearer.``  → close 4401
  3. ``bearer.`` malformed (bad signature)   → close 4401
  4. ``bearer.`` revoked / unknown secret    → close 4401
  5. Happy path                              → handshake completes,
                                                relay registers the
                                                serve socket under the
                                                token's project

The legacy ``/v1/projects/{id}/serve`` route was removed in Phase 6
step 3; this file is the sole coverage of the serve socket. The
legacy route never had its own tests — going away was a no-op for
the test suite.
