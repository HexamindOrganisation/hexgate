"""Tests for ``WS /v1/projects/{id}/chat`` — cookie-authed consumer socket.

The dashboard's Playground page drives this WebSocket from JavaScript.
Browsers can't set custom headers (e.g. ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`` from
``ws_serve``) on WS upgrades, so cookie auth is the only browser-
compatible option. The PR-#23 review caught that the route was wide
open: any client who could guess a ``project_id`` could connect,
eavesdrop on agent traffic, and relay arbitrary JSON back to the
serve process — bypassing every org-membership gate elsewhere.

Five branches, one per test:

  1. No cookie at all                       → close 4401, no handshake
  2. Cookie + non-member of project's org   → close 4401
  3. Cookie + unknown project_id            → close 4401
  4. Cookie + member of project's org       → handshake completes
  5. Garbage cookie (bad signature)         → close 4401
