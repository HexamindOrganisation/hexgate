"""Policy-module store + resolve/check API (see docs/adr/R-POL-001).

Project-scoped: a project holds boundary + capability modules and a role
binding, and the resolve/check endpoints compose them via the hexgate SDK.
Reads gate on org membership; writes gate on project admin/owner (policy edits
are a management action). A write to a modular project recompiles its agents'
