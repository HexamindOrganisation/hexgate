    An anomaly is defined as an abnormal rate of denied requests for a user in a 1-hour window with more than

    - High: deny rate >= 0.5
    - Medium: 0.3 <= deny rate < 0.5

    The current implementation loads all the data into memory and processes it in Python.
    Time complexity and space complexity are both O(n), with n the number of requests in the given time window.
    For large datasets, chunks of data can be processed in batches to avoid memory issues.
    An other approach is to pre-compute the anomalies in ClickHouse with a periodical job, and only compute the new anomalies in the API call.

    These optimizations should be implemented once the data volume grows and performance issues arise.
