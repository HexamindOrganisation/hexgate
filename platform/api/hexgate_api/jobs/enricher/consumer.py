"""The enricher's Kafka lifecycle and poll loop.

Correctness contract, in processing order per poll:
decode → per-span map/validate (rejects → DLQ envelopes, siblings survive)
→ resolve agent versions → three batch inserts (retried as a whole until
ClickHouse acks) → DLQ sends → offset commit. Committing only after the
ClickHouse ack means a crash anywhere in the cycle replays the poll on
restart, which is safe for the tables: event_id is the idempotency key and
ReplacingMergeTree collapses the duplicates. DLQ envelopes have no such key
and are simply re-sent on replay (see dlq.py).
