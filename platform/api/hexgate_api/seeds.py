"""Seed content for a fresh project.

The `default` agent showcases the full tool surface of the SDK —
web search, web fetch, filesystem navigation, file editing, and bash.
Risk gradient is encoded in the policy: read-only tools are `allow`,
side-effecting tools are `approval_required`. This gives the /graph
canvas meaningful edge colour variation out of the box.

`read_only` is the foil: same toolset, everything mutating is `deny`.
Two agents, one permissive + gated, one strictly read-only — enough
to tell the story of policy-driven control in a demo.
