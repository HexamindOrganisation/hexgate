"""Shared window/scope utilities for ClickHouse event-envelope reads.

Every event table (``policy_decision``, ``llm_invocation``, ...) shares the
same envelope columns — ``project_id``, ``occurred_at``, ``agent_name``,
``user_id`` — and the same accepted ingest window / dashboard time-range
handling (schema.sql's own header comment already anticipates future event
tables sharing this envelope). This module holds that shared logic once;
each feature's ``service.py`` imports from here instead of reaching into a
sibling feature's module.
