    Browsers can't set custom headers on WS handshakes; the standard

    offers two subprotocols on ``connect``:

      * ``bearer.<envelope>`` — the actual hexgate key, consumed by the
        server and never echoed back (kept out of any proxy mirror logs).
      * ``hexgate.v1`` — protocol marker; the server echoes this so the
        client knows the handshake bound a real auth context.

    On any reject path we ``close(code=4401)`` before ``accept()`` — the
    handshake never completes, the client sees a clean rejection
    instead of an immediate disconnect after an accepted upgrade. The
    handler that consumes this dependency must ``return`` when the
    result is ``None``.

    Counterpart of :func:`ws_require_project` for the cookie-auth side.
    Browsers can't set custom headers on WS upgrades — fine for
    ``ws_serve`` (the CLI sends a bearer subprotocol) but the dashboard
    drives ``ws_chat`` from JavaScript and can't reach for an
    Authorization header. We extract the ``hexgate_session`` cookie
    directly from the handshake.

    Three gates run in order:

      1. Cookie present → decode the JWT via the same strategy the
         HTTP cookie path uses.
      2. Decoded user exists + is active.
      3. User is a member of the project's org (any role).

    Any failure → ``close(code=4401)`` before ``accept()`` and return
    ``None``. On success → ``accept()`` and return the ``User``.

    Before this gate landed, ``ws_chat`` was a wide-open eavesdrop /
    inject surface: anyone who could guess or enumerate a ``project_id``
    could relay arbitrary JSON to a running serve process and read its
    replies. The bearer-subprotocol pattern from ``ws_require_project``
    doesn't work here because JS WebSocket can't set
    ``Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`` cookies — cookie auth is the only
    browser-compatible option.
