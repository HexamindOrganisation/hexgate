"""Outbound email — the seam between FastAPI Users' lifecycle hooks
(``on_after_register`` / ``on_after_request_verify`` /
``on_after_forgot_password``) and however the platform actually ships
mail at deploy time.

One method (``send(to, subject, body)``) so swapping providers is a
one-line change at boot. Tests swap in a list-capturing sender via
:func:`set_email_sender` to read tokens without parsing stderr.

Two implementations:
  * :class:`StderrEmailSender` — dev default; prints to stderr.
  * :class:`ResendEmailSender` — production; calls the Resend API.
