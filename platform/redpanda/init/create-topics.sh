# rpk auto-detects a container environment and applies dev-container

# config has no such key, so this isn't something the compose command
# controls. Left enabled, a producer using a wrong/stale topic name (or
# hitting the broker before this script has ever run) gets the topic
# silently fabricated with cluster defaults — 1 partition, 7-day
# retention — instead of a clear error. Applies live, no restart.

# `create --if-not-exists` only applies -c/--partitions on the branch
# where it actually creates the topic — on a topic that already exists
# (e.g. created earlier with different settings, or left over from a
# retention value this script used to set before a config change), it's
# a pure no-op: still exits 0, still prints "OK (topic already exists)",
# but the existing config is untouched. So retention is reconciled
# separately below, every run, regardless of whether create just made
# the topic or found it already there.
#
# Partition count is NOT reconciled the same way: rpk's only knob is
# `add-partitions --num N`, which ADDS N rather than setting a target,
# so it isn't idempotent and can't be dropped into a re-runnable script
# as-is. A topic created with the wrong partition count has to be
# recreated by hand — this script can't fix that drift. Disabling
# auto-creation above removes the main way that drift would happen
# unnoticed.
#
# max.message.bytes is reconciled the same way and for the same reason. 8 MiB
# is sized for LLM message events, whose input-message attribute is capped at
# 256 KiB SDK-side: the Collector batches at most 24 spans per record
# (send_batch_max_size in collector/config.yaml), so a worst-case record is
# 24 x 272 KiB = 6.375 MiB. The Collector's own producer limit and the
# enricher's fetch/produce limits are raised to match — see
# docs/internals/audit-pipeline.md §4.1/§4.2. Note this is a *broker-side*
# limit on the compressed batch; every client in the path has its own.
#
# The DLQ gets the same value only to keep the two topics from drifting apart.
# It does not need it: enricher/dlq.py caps an envelope's raw-record preview at
# 64 KiB and its attributes at 32 KiB, so no envelope it can build comes near
# even the 1 MiB broker default.
