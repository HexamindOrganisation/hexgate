/**
 * Shared "which agent is the user looking at?" selection, backed by the
 * `?agent=` URL param so it survives navigation between /agents,
 * /policies (and any other future route that operates on one agent).
 *
 * Before this hook: each route held a local ``useState`` and auto-picked
 * the first agent on mount — so clicking "edit policy →" from /agents
 * would land on /policies with a DIFFERENT agent selected than the one
 * the user was just viewing.
 *
 * ## Design constraints (learned the hard way in review)
 *
 * 1. **URL is source of truth, never silently rewritten.** If the user
 *    (or a shared bookmark) lands with ``?agent=support_bot`` and that
 *    agent was later renamed, we do NOT auto-rewrite the URL to some
 *    other agent — that turns "share this link" into "your colleague
 *    opens a random agent's policy." The stale name stays visible in
 *    the URL; ``fallbackName`` (the first agent, session-only) is what
 *    the picker/consumer actually renders while the URL disagrees.
 *
 * 2. **No mount-time clear.** A ``useEffect(clear, [projectId])`` fires
 *    on first render before the project ever "switches", so the effect
 *    would wipe every incoming ?agent= param on page load. Instead, the
 *    hook watches ``resetOn`` internally with a ref so it fires only on
 *    real transitions.
 *
 * 3. **Loading window preserves the URL.** During the query's first
 *    tick ``knownNames`` is an empty array or ``undefined``. Naively
 *    checking ``names.includes(raw)`` returns ``false`` and would drop
 *    the URL value on the floor. When names aren't known yet we trust
 *    the URL and expose ``raw`` — validation happens once the list
 *    arrives.
 *
 * 4. **Single hook, no split.** The two-hook split invited a caller to
 *    forget the memo or the auto-select effect; every caller ended up
 *    pasting the same three lines of glue. One hook, one call.
