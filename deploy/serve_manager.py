"""Run the hexgate serve loop IN-KERNEL, bound to a live agent object.

The visitor defines tools and the agent as real Python in notebook cells, so the
kernel holds an actual `agent` object. Rather than shipping its *source* to a
separate `hexgate serve` process, we run the serve loop here in the marimo
kernel (a background thread) bound to that exact object — what the dashboard
talks to *is* the object you defined. Edit the cells, click Apply, and the loop
restarts with the new object.

This is the same flow as `hexgate serve <spec>`:
    bootstrap() → build_runtime_from_local_agent(agent_obj=...) → run_serve(...)
only with a live object instead of a `module:attr` spec, run off-thread.

BYOK: the visitor's OpenAI key is set into this process's env (their own key,
their own throwaway container). HEXGATE_API_KEY (platform/relay auth) is read from
the file boot.py wrote.
