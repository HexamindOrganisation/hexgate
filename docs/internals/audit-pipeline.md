# Audit Pipeline Specification

> Status: living — kept in sync with the audit code. Last reviewed 2026-06.

Scope: the end-to-end path that records every policy decision a Hexgate-wrapped
agent makes, from the SDK enforcement point to durable storage in ClickHouse and
the dashboard read view.

This document is descriptive of the current implementation (PR
`gp/feat/sdk_emit_audit_event` + the platform audit endpoint). Where behaviour
is intentionally lossy or POC-grade, it says so explicitly.

---

## 1. Overview

Every time an agent proposes a tool call, the SDK's `PolicyEnforcer` produces a
`Decision` (allow / deny / needs_approval). The audit pipeline ships a copy of
that decision — **out of band, fire-and-forget** — to the platform, which
validates it, resolves server-owned identity fields, and appends one immutable
row to a ClickHouse table. Audit emission is a **side effect of enforcement**:
it never changes, blocks, or fails the decision the agent acts on.

### Design principles

1. **Enforcement is authoritative; audit is observational.** The `Decision`
   returned to the agent is the source of truth. Audit failures (network down,
   platform 503, saturation) degrade silently and never propagate to the caller.
   The same `Decision` is also surfaced locally by `hexgate chat`'s decision
   panel — same data, different sink, useful when iterating offline.
2. **The server owns identity.** `project_id`, `agent_version_id`, and
   `received_at` are resolved/stamped server-side and are **never trusted from
   the request body**, even though the SDK sends some of them as empty strings.
3. **One envelope, many event types.** The first eight columns/fields are a
   shared "envelope" intended to be reused by future event tables
   (`tool_invocation`, …). `policy_decision` is the first concrete event.
4. **Lossy under pressure, never blocking.** Both the SDK (drop on saturation)
   and the storage layer (byte caps, truncated `arguments`) prefer dropping or
   truncating data over slowing the agent.

---

## 2. The audit record

### 2.1 Stamped at the emission site

`hexgate/audit.py` — `AuditEvent` stamps the two audit identifiers at
construction. They live on the event, not on `Decision`: they exist only for
audit emission, and the no-audit path never constructs an event (so a
`decide()` call without a sender mints neither).

| Field | Type | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| `event_id` | `UUID` | `uuid4()` per event — the idempotency key end-to-end |
| `occurred_at` | `datetime` (UTC) | `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` at construction |

The enforcer builds the `AuditEvent` immediately after the `Decision`, so
`occurred_at` is decision time for practical purposes. The decision fields
(`agent_name`, `tool_name`, `outcome`, `role`, `reason`, `error_type`,
`violations`, `hint`, `arguments`) are populated by `Decision.from_verdict()`
from the policy engine's `Verdict` plus host context.

### 2.2 Outcome and error_type

```
DecisionOutcome   wire value        error_type (derived)
ALLOW             "allow"           "" (no error tag)
DENY              "deny"            "policy_denied"
NEEDS_APPROVAL    "needs_approval"  "approval_required"
```

### 2.3 Wire payload — `AuditEvent.as_payload()`

`hexgate/audit.py` — `AuditEvent` wraps a `Decision` plus the caller identity
read from the active `User` scope (`user_id`, `session_id`). `as_payload()`
produces a flat JSON object whose keys mirror the platform's `DecisionEvent`:

```json
{
  "event_id":    "0b9c…",          // str(UUID)
  "occurred_at": "2026-06-01T13:00:00+00:00",  // ISO 8601, tz-aware
  "agent_name":  "researcher",
  "tool_name":   "read_file",
  "outcome":     "deny",
  "role":        "analyst",        // "" when no role
  "error_type":  "policy_denied",  // "" for allow
  "reason":      "denied for path",
  "violations":  ["v1", "v2"],     // tuple → list
  "hint":        {"glob": "/x/**"},// or null
  "arguments":   {"path": "/etc/passwd"},  // or null; may be truncated upstream
  "user_id":     "alice",          // "" when no User scope
  "session_id":  "sess_1"          // "" when unset
}
```

Server-resolved fields (`project_id`, `agent_version_id`, `received_at`) are
**deliberately absent** from the wire payload.

---

## 3. SDK emission layer

### 3.1 Where emission happens

`PolicyEnforcer.decide()` (`hexgate/security/enforcer.py`):

1. Resolve `role` from the active `User` contextvar.
2. Ask the policy engine for a `Verdict`; lift it into a `Decision`.
3. If an `AuditSender` was injected into this enforcer, `emit()` an `AuditEvent`.
4. Return the `Decision` to the adapter (synchronous, unaffected by step 3).

The sender is **injected per enforcer**, not looked up globally — see §3.4.

### 3.2 `AuditSender` — fire-and-forget POST

`hexgate/audit.py`. `emit()` is synchronous and non-blocking; it schedules a
background `asyncio.Task` that performs the POST. Key behaviours:

- **Bounded concurrency.** An `asyncio.Semaphore(max_in_flight=32)` caps
  concurrent POSTs.
- **Drop on saturation.** If the semaphore is already exhausted, `emit()`
  increments a dropped counter and returns immediately. A warning is logged on
  the 1st, 101st, 201st… drop (`_dropped % 100 == 1`).
- **No event loop → skip.** If `emit()` is called with no running loop (a sync
  entry point), it no-ops with a one-time warning. Sync agents therefore emit
  no audit unless wrapped in `asyncio.run`.
- **Single 503 retry.** `_send` retries once on HTTP 503 after
  `min(http_timeout, 2.0)`s. Other `>= 400` responses are logged, not retried.
- **Network errors swallowed.** `httpx.RequestError` is logged at WARNING and
  dropped; it never surfaces to the agent.
- **HTTP client:** `httpx.AsyncClient`, 5s timeout, `Authorization: Bearer
  <api_key>` header.

### 3.3 Loop-rebinding safety

asyncio primitives (the semaphore, and httpx's connection pool) bind to the
first event loop that drives them and reject use from any other loop. Because
the sender is a process-global, a process that runs **more than one event loop**
(repeated `asyncio.run`, a job worker, a test suite, a notebook) would otherwise
crash on the second loop. `AuditSender` tracks the loop it is bound to and
**rebuilds its client + semaphore when the running loop changes**, so a reused
sender survives loop rotation. Construction stays eager so `configure()` remains
synchronous.

### 3.4 Configuration & lifecycle

`configure(api_key=None, base_url=None) -> AuditSender | None`:

- Resolves `api_key` from the argument or `HEXGATE_KEY`; returns `None` (audit
  inert) when no key is resolvable.
- Resolves `base_url` from the argument or `HEXGATE_API_URL`, defaulting to
  `http://localhost:8000`. The endpoint is `<base_url>/v1/audit/decisions`.
- **Keyed by api_key.** Senders live in a registry `dict[str, AuditSender]`.
  Calling `configure()` again with the **same** key returns the existing sender
  (idempotent); a **different** key gets its own sender with its own bearer
  token. This is what lets one process audit several tenants/keys correctly.

Each adapter wrapper (`wrap_langchain_agent`, `wrap_openai_agent`,
`wrap_google_agent`, `wrap_pydantic_agent`) and `factory.enforce_policy` call
`configure()` with their resolved key and inject the returned sender into the
`PolicyEnforcer` they build. `bootstrap()` also calls `configure()` (env key) so
local runs work without an explicit key.

#### Local mode (`HEXGATE_LOCAL_MODE`)

Setting `HEXGATE_LOCAL_MODE=1` makes `configure()` return `None` even when
`HEXGATE_KEY` is present in env. `bootstrap(local_only=True)` sets the var
*before* the first `configure()` call, and `hexgate chat` passes
`local_only=True` — so the inner-loop REPL never posts audit events even if
a key has been lingering in `.env` from an earlier platform session.

The gate is re-checked on every `configure()` call (not cached), so an adapter
wrapper that re-`configure`s post-bootstrap still respects it. The truthy
value parser accepts `1` / `true` / `yes` / `on` (case-insensitive).

There are now two clean operating modes, not three:

| Mode | `HEXGATE_KEY` | `HEXGATE_LOCAL_MODE` | Policy from | Audit |
|------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Local** | (irrelevant) | `1`, or unset with no key | YAML / disk / builtin | suppressed |
| **Platform-managed** | set | unset | platform fetch | emitted |

A single INFO line (`audit suppressed: HEXGATE_LOCAL_MODE=1 (...)`) is logged
the first time `configure()` is called with both a key and local mode active
— exactly the case where the suppression would be surprising. The "no key
anywhere" case stays quiet.

A separate WARNING fires from `bootstrap()` itself when both `HEXGATE_KEY`
and `HEXGATE_LOCAL_POLICY` are set — that combination is almost always a
forgotten env entry from an earlier session, and surfacing it at startup
saves a later debugging detour.

> For the user-facing description of when each mode applies in practice
> — chat vs. serve, inner loop vs. team loop — see the
> ["Which path do I pick?"](/two-paths) page.

`async shutdown()` drains in-flight tasks and closes every sender's HTTP client.
It is safe to call multiple times and is the recommended teardown hook. Absent
it, background sends still pending when the event loop tears down are
**cancelled, not finished** — events emitted shortly before process exit are
lost. GC closing the httpx client does not flush anything.

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `configure(key, url)` | Get-or-create the sender for `key`. Idempotent per key. |
| `get_sender(key)` | Registry lookup by key (diagnostics). Prefer the injected sender. |
| `shutdown()` | Drain + close all senders. |

---

## 4. Platform ingest endpoint

`POST /v1/audit/decisions` (`platform/api/main.py` → `ingest_decision`).

### 4.1 Request

- **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <hexgate_key>`. `require_project` verifies
  the key and resolves it to a `project_id`. Missing/invalid → **401**.
- **Body:** `DecisionEvent` (`platform/api/schemas.py`), a pydantic model that
  extends `AuditEnvelope`. Field-level validation (max lengths, enum membership)
  happens here; a malformed body → **422** (FastAPI validation).
- **ClickHouse dependency:** `require_clickhouse` resolves the client and maps a
  connect failure to **503** with `Retry-After: 5`.

### 4.2 Server-side processing

1. **Clock-skew / retention guard.** Reject `occurred_at` more than 5 minutes in
   the future (`CLOCK_SKEW_FUTURE`) or older than the 90-day `RETENTION_WINDOW`
   → **400**.
2. **Resolve `agent_version_id`** = latest `AgentVersion.id` for
   `(project_id, agent_name)`, or `""` if the agent isn't registered. Unknown
   agents still log; the version is just empty.
3. **Insert** via `audit.insert_decision`. `project_id` (bearer-resolved) and
   `agent_version_id` (platform lookup) are passed explicitly and override
   anything in the body.

### 4.3 Responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **202 Accepted** | Row written. Body: `{"event_id": "<uuid>"}`. (Sync write, see §5.2 — 202 reflects "queued/durable" semantics but the insert has actually completed.) |
| **400** | `occurred_at` outside the accepted time window. |
| **401** | Missing/malformed/invalid/revoked bearer key. |
| **413** | `arguments` > 8 KiB or `hint` > 4 KiB after JSON serialization. |
| **422** | Body failed schema validation, **or** ClickHouse rejected the row (non-transient — retry won't help). |
| **503** | ClickHouse unreachable or transient insert failure (`OperationalError`). Retryable; carries `Retry-After`. |

### 4.4 Trust boundary

`AuditEnvelope` is intentionally **narrower** than the storage row. The body
carries only `event_id`, `occurred_at`, `agent_name`, `session_id`, `user_id`
(envelope) plus the decision fields. `project_id`, `agent_version_id`, and
`received_at` are server-owned and cannot be spoofed by the SDK.

---

## 5. Storage — ClickHouse

`platform/clickhouse/init/schema.sql`. Database `hexgate_audit`, table
`policy_decision`.

> ⚠️ The `init/` directory runs **once on an empty volume**. Editing the schema
> after first boot is ignored — use a real migration runner for changes.

### 5.1 Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE hexgate_audit.policy_decision
(
  -- Envelope (shared with future event tables)
  event_id            UUID,
  occurred_at         DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),
  received_at         DateTime64(3, 'UTC') DEFAULT now64(3),   -- server-stamped
  project_id          LowCardinality(String),
  agent_name          LowCardinality(String),
  agent_version_id    LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT '',
  session_id          String                 DEFAULT '',
  user_id             LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT '',

  -- Decision-specific
  tool_name           LowCardinality(String),
  role                LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT '',
  outcome             Enum8('allow'=1, 'deny'=2, 'needs_approval'=3),
  error_type          LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT '',
  reason              String,
  violations          Array(String),
  hint                String CODEC(ZSTD(3)),
  arguments           String CODEC(ZSTD(3))  -- SDK-truncated JSON; may be lossy
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(occurred_at)
ORDER BY (project_id, agent_name, outcome, occurred_at)
TTL toDateTime(occurred_at) + INTERVAL 90 DAY
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;
```

- **`occurred_at`** is event time (SDK), **`received_at`** is ingest time
  (server default). Reads order by `received_at`; retention/partitioning key off
  `occurred_at`.
- **Sort key** `(project_id, agent_name, outcome, occurred_at)` optimizes the
  expected query shape: "decisions for a project/agent, filtered by outcome,
  newest within a window."
- **`hint` / `arguments`** are stored as ZSTD-compressed JSON strings, not native
  JSON, and are documented as potentially lossy (`arguments` is SDK-truncated;
  see §6).
- **TTL 90 days** — rows self-expire, consistent with the ingest retention guard.

### 5.2 Insert semantics

`platform/api/audit.py` — `insert_decision`:

- **Byte caps before write:** `arguments` JSON ≤ 8 KiB, `hint` JSON ≤ 4 KiB,
  else `AuditPayloadTooLarge` → 413. `None` serializes to `""`.
- **Insert settings:** `async_insert=1`, `wait_for_async_insert=1`,
  `async_insert_deduplicate=1`. Small inserts are batched server-side, but the
  call **blocks until the batch flushes**, so a write failure surfaces
  synchronously rather than being acked-then-dropped — an audit log must not
  silently lose acknowledged rows.
- **Dedup:** `async_insert_deduplicate` plus the unique `event_id` provides
  idempotency across SDK retries (the single 503 retry, or any at-least-once
  delivery): re-POSTing the same `event_id` does not create a duplicate row.

---

## 6. Privacy & data-handling notes

- **`arguments` carries tool inputs** (paths, payloads, possibly PII). It is
  transmitted to the platform and stored (compressed) for up to 90 days. The
  default `base_url` is **plaintext `http://localhost:8000`**; production
  deployments must set `HEXGATE_API_URL` to a TLS endpoint.
- **Default key-name redaction, always on.** `AuditEvent.as_payload()` replaces
  values whose key matches `password|passwd|secret|token|api[-_]?key|
  credential|authorization` (case-insensitive, recursive into nested
  dicts/lists) with `"[REDACTED]"` before transmission. **This is a seatbelt,
  not a guarantee**: values sensitive by *content* rather than key name — SQL
  strings, email bodies, free text — are captured verbatim. Operators whose
  tools carry such data need their own redaction before relying on this in
  production.
- **SDK truncation at the platform cap.** `as_payload()` measures `arguments`
  as the platform does (JSON, `default=str`); over 8 KiB it replaces the dict
  with `{"_truncated": true, "original_bytes": N, "preview": <JSON prefix>}`
  sized to fit the cap. Lossy, but the event is stored — the platform
  **rejects** (413) oversize payloads, so an untrimmed over-cap decision would
  not be stored at all. `hint` (4 KiB cap) is policy-engine-generated and is
  *not* SDK-trimmed.

---

## 7. Read path — aggregation endpoints

The raw `GET /v1/audit/decisions?limit=N` debug dump has been **removed**.
Reads are now project-scoped aggregation endpoints that group server-side in
ClickHouse (query-time `GROUP BY`; no rollups/materialized views). The table's
sort key `(project_id, agent_name, outcome, occurred_at)` and `LowCardinality`
columns make these scans cheap. All time-axis logic keys off `occurred_at`
(event time), never `received_at`. See `platform/api/audit.py` (`summarize`,
`timeseries`, `list_decisions`).

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}/audit/summary?window=` | Totals + denial counts, plus breakdowns by agent / role / tool (one `GROUPING SETS` query). |
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}/audit/timeseries?window=` | Per-bucket outcome counts (`toStartOfInterval`); bucket size tracks the window. |
| `GET /v1/projects/{id}/audit/decisions?window=&agent=&role=&outcome=&limit=&offset=` | Filterable detail rows, newest first, with `total` for pagination; `hint`/`arguments` decoded back to objects. |

- **`window`** is `24h` / `7d` / `30d` / `90d`, validated by a `Literal` (bad
  value → 422) and bounded by the 90-day storage TTL. `role=` (empty value)
  selects the empty-role bucket; an absent `role` means "no filter". No
  sentinel string is reserved on the wire — the dashboard's "(none)" is a
  display label only.
- **Concurrency.** A client firing several of these reads at once (e.g. a
  dashboard loading summary + timeseries + decisions together) would otherwise
  hit "concurrent queries within the same session". The shared, process-global
  ClickHouse client is created with `autogenerate_session_id=False`
  (`platform/api/clickhouse.py`) so the thread-safe HTTP pool serves concurrent
  queries in parallel; this also hardens the ingest path under load.

> Still POC-grade on **auth**: the endpoints are project-scoped (gap #1 partly
> closed) but not yet gated behind the `read_audit` scope — they carry a
> `TODO(auth)` marker, matching the unauth posture of the other dashboard reads
> (`/agents`, `/tokens`). Scope enforcement must land before exposure beyond
> local development.

## 8. Failure-mode summary

| Failure | SDK behaviour | Agent impact |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| No api_key configured | `configure()` returns `None`; no sender injected | none (audit inert) |
| No running event loop | `emit()` no-ops, one-time warning | none |
| Sender saturated | event dropped, periodic warning | none |
| Platform returns 503 | one retry, then network-error log | none |
| Platform returns 413/422/400 | logged as ingest error (`>= 400`) | none |
| Network unreachable | `RequestError` logged, dropped | none |
| Event loop rotates | client + semaphore rebuilt transparently | none |

| Failure | Platform behaviour |
|---------|--------------------|
| ClickHouse unreachable | 503 + `Retry-After` (startup logs a warning, does not crash) |
| Transient insert error | 503 + `Retry-After` |
| Storage rejects row | 422 (retry won't help) |
| Oversize args/hint | 413 |
| Bad/missing bearer | 401 |
| occurred_at out of window | 400 |

## 9. Open items / known gaps

1. **Read path auth & scoping** — `GET /v1/audit/decisions` is unauthenticated
   and cross-project (POC). Needs `read_audit` scope + `project_id` filter.
2. **`arguments` redaction is key-name-only** — the default redactor strips
   sensitive-keyed values, but content-sensitive values (SQL, email bodies)
   pass through; no per-tool allow/deny lists or `redact` callable yet.
3. **Default transport is plaintext HTTP** — safe only for localhost; require
   TLS via `HEXGATE_API_URL` elsewhere.
4. **Sync agents emit nothing** — `emit()` requires a running loop; sync entry
   points silently produce no audit.
5. **Schema evolution** — `init/schema.sql` runs once; there is no migration
   runner wired up yet.
6. **At-least-once, not exactly-once end to end** — the SDK can drop on
   saturation/network failure (audit is best-effort); `event_id` dedup prevents
   duplicates but not gaps.
7. **Write path is unscoped within a project** — `POST /v1/audit/decisions`
   authorizes via `require_project` (signature + project resolution only); any
   valid SDK bearer for the project can write audit, fetch policy, and register
   agents interchangeably. The biscuit attenuation primitive already exists
   (`platform/api/biscuits.py`); an `emit_audit` scope fact + endpoint check is
   the natural fix. Note existing minted tokens won't carry the fact — needs a
   deprecation window or re-mint.
8. **No rate limit or volume alerting on ingest** — an exfiltrated key can
   flood the log to bury real activity. Needs a per-project token bucket
   (`429 + Retry-After`; the SDK already logs-and-drops on ≥400) plus an
   ingest-volume-per-project alert.
