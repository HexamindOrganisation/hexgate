"""``PolicyBundle`` — a loadable, integrity-checked policy artifact.

A bundle is what ``fortify policy build`` emits: a directory containing
the source ``policy.yaml``, the compiled ``policy.rego``, the
``policy.wasm`` blob, and a ``policy.bundle.json`` manifest holding the
content hashes. This class wraps the on-disk layout so the runtime can
load + verify + evaluate in one motion.

Today the bundle is content-addressed by sha256 (hashes in the manifest
match sha256 of the on-disk artifacts). M2 phase 6 layers an Ed25519
signature on top: the platform signs the manifest, the runtime checks
the signature before trusting the hashes. Until then, integrity is a
local check — useful for "bundle wasn't corrupted in transit" but not
a defense against malicious authors.
